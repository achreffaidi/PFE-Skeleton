\qquad 

This chapter will begin by discussing the infrastructure design and the reasoning behind the different technical choices we had to make. Later, we will use the Infrastructure as Code approach to implementing it.

The following figure\ref{fig:product_diagram} explains the communications between the different components:

The following subsections will go through the service deployment, networking architecture, security, and disaster recovery strategy that we have in place.

\subsection{Final design}

You can see in the following figure\ref{fig:pro-diagram} a simplified version of our final infrastructure design. It important to know that we're not representing only the main components as the full diagram is much complex and contains a lot of boilerplate resources.

\section{Infrastructure deployment}

This section will show the actual implementation of the infrastructure using Terraform and the final result.

\section*{Conclusion}
\addcontentsline{toc}{section}{Conclusion} 
\qquad In this chapter, we provided a high-level overview of the product infrastructure design and the reasoning behind some of our architectural decisions. We also demonstrated how we used Terraform to build the infrastructure.
In the next chapter, we will show the measures we have for quality assurance.
